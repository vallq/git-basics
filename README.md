# Git Basics

This repository will help you get comfortable with basic git operations: making changes and publishing them.

We will learn the following git operations:

- `add` changes to the staging area
- `commit` changes
- `push` local commits to publish them to GitHub
- `pull` changes from the remote repository

Other useful commands to see what is going on the git repository:

- `status`
- `log`

## Exercises

- [x] Fork this repo
- [x] Clone this repo
- [x] Update the README: add some lines to the end and push them to GitHub
- [ ] Create a new file called `newfile.txt`, add some contents to it and push it to GitHub
- [ ] Update newfile.txt and push the changes to GitHub
- [ ] Open the repository on GitHub and make changes to `newfile.txt`
- [ ] Pull the changes to your local repository

## Discuss

What is the difference between `add`, `commit`, and `push`?

Add: updates changes in the queue
Commit: confirm the changes being made in the queue
Push: updating the remote git repository with the local changes made
